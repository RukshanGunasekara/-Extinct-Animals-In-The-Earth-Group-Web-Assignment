brachiosaur, (genus Brachiosaurus), any member or relative of the dinosaur genus Brachiosaurus, which lived 150 million to 130 million years ago from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous Period. Fossilized remains of brachiosaurs are found in Africa, North America, and Europe. Brachiosaurs were built like huge giraffes; they had immensely long necks and relatively short tails. Their morphology is unusual among dinosaurs in that the forelimbs were longer than the hind limbs. This dinosaur's long neck helped it to feed at an incredible height of 49ft (15m). It used its spoon-shaped teeth to snip off leaves from trees like conifers and tree ferns. Brachiosaurus ate about 440lb (200kg) of leaves and twigs per day.
