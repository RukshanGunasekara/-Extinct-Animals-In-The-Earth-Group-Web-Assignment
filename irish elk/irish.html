               <h1>IRISH ELK</h1>
                   <p>The Irish elk stood about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall at the shoulders, and had large palmate (flat and broad) antlers, the largest known of any known deer, with the largest specimens reaching over 3.5 m (11 ft) from tip to tip (though it is rare for specimens to exceed 3 metres (9.8 ft) across) and 40 kg (88 lb) in weight.About 400,000 years ago, Irish elk (Megaloceros giganteus) roamed Europe and Asia during the Pleistocene. This species became extinct about 8,000 years ago. Because this species was an impressively large deer standing nearly 7 feet at the shoulder.Like all deer, the Irish elk was herbivorous. Scientists think they ate a lot of leaves, grasses, herbs, shrubs, fruits, and stems. </p>
